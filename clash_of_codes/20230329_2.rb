# In golf course, each hole has a "par", value which is the maximum number of swings that players should ideally need to clear the hole.
#
#Once a player has cleared the hole, the par is subtracted from the player's effective swing count, resulting in the player's score for that hole (i.e. 2 swings for a par 3 scores -1).
#
#The final score for a player on a course is the total of his scores for each hole in the course.
#
#Given a score card for a 18-hole course, your program must output the player's score.
#Input
#Line 1: 18 numbers separated by spaces, representing the pars for each hole.
#Line 2: 18 numbers separated by spaces, representing the player's swing count for each hole.
#
#Output
#Line 1: the player's final score for the course.
#
#Example
#Input
#4 4 3 4 4 5 4 3 5 4 3 4 5 4 4 3 4 5
#4 3 2 4 3 4 3 3 4 4 3 4 6 4 5 3 3 4
#
#Output
#-6
