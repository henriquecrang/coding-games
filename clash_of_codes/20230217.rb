#Goal
#As Logan's 4 year-old daughter is new to maths, she has trouble understanding sums when they are given in a string with numbers in an arbitrary order, such as 3+5+2.
#Therefore, her father will help her to understand sums by arranging the numbers of each string sum in ascending order, such as 2+3+5.
#
#Your job is to help Logan arrange the numbers in ascending order and print the sum in a form that his daughter can understand.
#Input
#Line 1 : the string sum.
#Output
#A string containing the sum described in sum with each number in ascending order.
#Constraints
#sum contains only digits and the + character.
#None of the numbers of sum are negative.
#Every number of sum has a single digit.
#sum is at most 100 characters long.
#Example
#Input
#
#1+3+2
#
#Output
#
#1+2+3
#
#
x = ''
gets.each_char{|c|
x+=c if c.to_i.to_s == c

}
puts x.chars.sort.join("+")
